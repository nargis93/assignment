    "Lasso regression is a regularization technique. It is used over regression methods for a more accurate prediction. This model uses shrinkage. Shrinkage is where data values are shrunk towards a central point as the mean."

    "ans - \n",
    "The main advantage of a LASSO regression model is that it has the ability to set the coefficients for features it does not consider interesting to zero. This means that the model does some automatic feature selection to decide which features should and should not be included on its own."

    "ans - \n",
    "The coefficients can be used to understand the impact of each feature on the target variable, and also help in feature selection. In this case, we can see that some of the coefficients are zero, indicating that those features may not be important in predicting the target variable."

    "A tuning parameter (Î»), sometimes called a penalty parameter, controls the strength of the penalty term in ridge regression and lasso regression. It is basically the amount of shrinkage, where data values are shrunk towards a central point, like the mean."

    "Lasso is a modification of linear regression, where the model is penalized for the sum of absolute values of the weights. Thus, the absolute values of weight will be (in general) reduced, and many will tend to be zeros."
