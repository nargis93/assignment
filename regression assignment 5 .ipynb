    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "ans \n",
    "Elastic net regression is a type of linear regression that combines the advantages of lasso and ridge methods. It can handle multicollinearity, reduce overfitting, and select relevant features. But it also has some drawbacks and challenges that you should be aware of"

    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "ans \n",
    "Larger values of alpha imply stronger regularization (less-overfitting, may be underfitting!). Smaller values imply weak regularization (overfitting). We want to build a model that neither overfits nor underfit the data. So, we need to choose an optimal value for alpha."

    "ADVANTAGES\n",
    "Elastic net regression has several advantages over lasso and ridge regression, depending on the data and the problem. For instance, it can handle multicollinearity better than lasso regression by grouping correlated features and selecting the most representative ones.\n",
    "DISADVANTAGES\n",
    "It may not perform optimally when there is no correlation between features or when the number of features is much smaller than the number of observations, as it may lose predictive power or introduce bias."

    "ANS \n",

    "2.When the response is missing, we can use a predictive model to predict the missing response, then create a new fully-observed dataset containing the predictions instead of the missing values, and finally re-estimate the predictive model in this expanded dataset"

    "Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?\n",
    "ANS \n",
    "The coefficients that are zero indicate that the corresponding features are not relevant for the model, and they are eliminated by the lasso penalty. Therefore, you can use the coefficients of elastic net regression to rank the features by their importance and select the ones that have non-zero coefficients."
