    "order or ranking. Examples of nominal data include gender (male/female), race (White/Black/Asian), religion \n",
    "(Christianity/Islam/Judaism), and blood type (A/B/AB/O).\n",
    "Ordinal Data:\n",
    "Ordinal data is a type of data that consists of categories that can be ordered or ranked. However, the distance between\n",
    "categories is not necessarily equal. Ordinal data is often used to measure subjective attributes or opinions, where there \n",
    "is a natural order to the responses. Examples of ordinal data include education level (elementary/middle/high school/college),\n",
    "job position (manager/supervisor/employee), and Likert scales (strongly agree/agree/disagree/strongly disagree).\n",
    "Interval Data:\n",
    "Interval data is a type of data that consists of numerical values where the distance between each value is equal. However, \n",
    "there is no true zero point. Interval data is often used to measure attributes such as temperature, dates, and time. Examples\n",
    "of interval data include temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit), dates (days/months/years), and time (hours/minutes/seconds).\n",
    "Ratio Data:\n",
    "Ratio data is a type of data that has a true zero point and an equal distance between each value. Ratio data is considered\n",
    "the most informative type of data because it can be used to make meaningful comparisons and calculations. In addition, ratio\n",
    "data can be used to perform all types of statistical analyses.\n",

    "(miles/kilometers). For instance, if someone’s height is 60 inches, it means that they are 5 feet tall, and if their height \n",
    "is 72 inches,\n",
    "it means that they are 6 feet tall. Moreover, if someone’s weight is 150 pounds, it means that they weigh 68 kilograms."
