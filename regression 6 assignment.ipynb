    "Q2. Explain the difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting.\n",
    "ANS \n",
    "1.Cloud hosting offers a level of scalability that traditional hosting can't. Cloud hosting companies provide virtual space on an on-demand, as-needed basis. Instead of paying for a set amount of space upfront on a single server, the user pays as they go for what they actually use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Traditional hosting, especially shared hosting, has its drawbacks though. Because the resources of a single server are shared among a number of different websites, spikes in traffic to those websites can mean decreased performance for your own. Security breaches and other performance issues on other sites make take yours down as well. And thereâ€™s a single point of failure. If the server itself experiences technical problems, everyone hosted on that server will be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cloud hosting companies provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). They house, run, and maintain all of the necessary hardware, and the customer pays for the resources the use, similar to how we pay for utilities like electricity."
