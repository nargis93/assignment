    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in\n",
    "a computer system.\n",
    "SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational. SQL databases use structured query language (SQL)\n",
    "and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. SQL databases are vertically s\n",
    "calable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 2 =\n",
    "DDL statements are similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas. Common examples of DDL statements include CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.\n",
    "Today's databases incorporate DDL in any formal language that describes data, although it is considered a subset of SQL.\n",
    "CREATE TABLE\n",
    "The CREATE TABLE command creates a new table in the database.\n",
    "ALTER TABLE\n",
    "The ALTER TABLE command adds, deletes, or modifies columns in a table.\n",
    "The ALTER TABLE command also adds and deletes various constraints in a table.\n",

    "DQL (Data Query Language) Command in SQL\n",
    "DQL or data query language is to perform the query on the data inside the schema or object (ie table, index, view,\n",

    "like analyzing the data.\n",
    "The SELECT command is used to query or retrieve data from a table in the database. It is used to retrieve a subset of records from one or more tables. The SELECT command can be used in various forms:\n",

    "\n",
    "-- select first_name from Customers table \n",
    "SELECT first_name\n",
    "FROM Customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS 5 =\n",
    "A primary key generally focuses on the uniqueness of the table. It assures the value in the specific column is unique.\n",
    "A foreign key is generally used to build a relationship between the two tables. The table allows only one primary key.\n",
